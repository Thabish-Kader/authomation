# Speech Translation Tool

This is a Python script that allows you to translate spoken English phrases to German. The script uses the Google Speech Recognition API to transcribe the spoken phrase, then uses the Google Translate API to translate it to German. The translated text is then converted to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech API and played back to the user.
